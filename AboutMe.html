  <h1>Waste Management In Bhutan</h1>
  <p>Bhutan is GNH country where conservation of environment is one of the pillar of GNH. Government OF Bhutan have taken many steps towards preservation and conservation of environment through proper waste management. Waste production has become an unavoidable consequence of the rapid population growth of Thimphu. It is essential that we manage waste properly to build sustainable and livable cities. Critical issues such as these must be addressed by both the residents of Thimphu as well as the government.

  <h2> Portfolio</h2>
<p> I am Anjana Gurung and I am from Bhutan. I am a student trying to explore in various areas by learning new things. I enjoy taking this coding class and loved the logic and structure of coding. It has taught me with elegant and efficient code whether it be HTML and CSS.
  <br>
  When I am not coding or not studying,you will be finding me in the  room full colorful novels imagining and reading the novel on the court of shooting some hopes while pretending to live in fantasy.Thank you sowcoder team for providing free classes with brillant teachers and mentors.
