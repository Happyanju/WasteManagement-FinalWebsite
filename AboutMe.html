  <h1> About Me</h1>
<p> I am Anjana Gurung and I am from Bhutan. I am a student trying to explore in various areas by learning new things. I enjoy taking this coding class and loved the logic and structure of coding. It has taught me with elegant and efficient code whether it be HTML and CSS.
  <br>
  When i am not coding or not studying,you will be finding me in the  room full colorful novels imagining and reading the novel on the court of shooting some hopes while pretending to live in fantasy.
